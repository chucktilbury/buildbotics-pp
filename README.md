# BuildBotics Post Processors

These are post processors for QCAD/CAM that create gcode for the BuildBotics controller. 

There are 4 files:
  * BuildBoticsIN.js -- This creates gcode for imperial measurements and assumes the presence of a tool changer.
  * BuildBoticsMM.js -- This creates gcode for metric measurements and assumes the presence of a tool changer.
  * BuildBoticsNoToolChangerIN.js -- This creates gcode for imperial measurements and assumes there is no tool changer.
  * BuildBoticsNoToolChangerMM.js -- This creates gcode for metric measurements and assumes there is no tool changer.
  
These files are provided with no restrictions, warranty, or support. If you break something or hurt yourself, you are the only one responsible for it.
